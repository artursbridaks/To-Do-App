**To-Do App**

This simple To-Do List App was created in efforts to learn about how JavaScript Local Storage works and how to manage (manipulate, display etc.) the saved data.

**Introduction**

To run the app:

* Clone the app to your local machine
* Make sure you have opened it on Visual Studio Code
* To run the live-server press ALT+L+O
* (or press the "Go Live" button on the lower right-hand sight)
* The browser should open automatically
